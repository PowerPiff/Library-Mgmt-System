# Library_Mgmt-System
This is a library management system for my MSc project

This program was developed over the span of 1 week. It is a simple system that performs the basic functions of a library system. 
People can rent books, use computers etc.
It was to be fulfilled to a set of criteria, which I had the creative freedom to implament how I saw fit.
